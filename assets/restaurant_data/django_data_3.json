The restaurant's cozy ambiance and warm atmosphere created the perfect setting for breaking fast and enjoying a delightful meal.\n\nThe menu at Al Dimashqi Kingdom Restaurant offers a wide variety of Syrian Arabic dishes, and I was particularly impressed with their shawarma, pizza, and lamb mansaf rice. The shawarma was packed with succulent and well-seasoned meat, perfectly wrapped in soft bread. The pizza had a unique Syrian twist with its blend of flavors and toppings, making it a pleasant surprise. As for the lamb mansaf rice, it was a true highlight of the meal, with tender lamb cooked to perfection and served over fragrant, flavorful rice. Each dish showcased the authentic taste of Syrian cuisine and left me wanting more.\n\nLocated in Cyberjaya, Al Dimashqi Kingdom Restaurant is a must-visit for Arabic food enthusiasts. While the prices may be slightly on the premium side, the quality and flavors of the food make it well worth it. The restaurant provides an opportunity to savor the authentic tastes of Syria without leaving Cyberjaya.\n\nDuring my visit, the staff at Al Dimashqi Kingdom Restaurant provided excellent service, catering to the needs of guests and ensuring a pleasant dining experience. Their attentiveness and knowledge of the menu added to the overall satisfaction of the visit.\n\nIf you find yourself in Cyberjaya, I highly recommend visiting Al Dimashqi Kingdom Restaurant. Whether you're breaking fast during Ramadhan or looking for a delicious Arabic meal, this restaurant offers a cozy ambiance, a variety of mouthwatering dishes including shawarma, pizza, and lamb mansaf rice, and a taste of authentic Syrian flavors.",

The kunefe was absolutely delicious and more akin to middle Eastern style kunefe which tends to be soft, cheesy and with powdered dough that makes the texture more cake-like.

There are 15 of us and restaurant suggest to pre-order our food to prevent long waiting time. The moment we arrive, we were greeted warmly by Mr Tamam who is the manager and brought us to our seat. The food was almost ready and we did not have to wait long and immediately enjoyed fresh hot steaming dishes from  the kitchen.\n\nThe mixed grill was presented with fire which captured my guest and all the other food were presented very nice and appetizing. Food was delicious, mixed grill is perfectly grill and not dry, mandy chicken and lamb haneeth were nice and tender, eggplant lamb, fahsah and saltah taste good too with the fresh bread. Oh ya the mixed appetizer is very authentic and we end our dinner with most popular kunafa. We ordered 2 type (original & pistachio) and both were very very delicious. Its the best kunafa we have tasted in Malaysia. We truly enjoyed our dinner and Mr Tamam is a very great host to make sure our dining experience wonderful. This is our first and definitely not our last time and we surely enjoyed our dinner last night. Perfect place to celebrate any occasion.",

It was very good and flavourful. \nApologies for the poor photo quality. We took the photo after quite a few bites \n\nAvocado & Egg - I guess if you like Avocado, good. Not for me though\n\nSignature Molten Egg - Good as well. I think it was also good that the server was an idiot giving us the wrong information. This was too cheesy for me. I preferred the Pulled Beef Egg Benedict.\n\nBakers Breakfast - we think it was done very well... Very good, if you like sausages and Beef Bacon.\n\nDrinks - various. It was OK, but can be improved.\n\nFor this price point... It really have to improve a lot, if you ask me. Then again, business is so good, I guess they just don't care? \n\nWill I return?

The delivery arrived an hour later, well, it was for dinner.\n\nLet me say that it was heavy! And very fulfilling! The bread itself was so soft, pillowy and yummy! The lettuce, tomato slice and pickles were fresh! I love it! Now I know where to get my fish burger! My husband inhaled his food, as usual. Lolz.\n\n4 thumbs up to the Cyberjaya team! Kudos!!!",

The chocolate cake was rich, moist, and perfectly balanced, not too sweet, just right!\nThe staff were super friendly and welcoming, making us feel really comfortable throughout our visit. The atmosphere was cozy and peaceful, with natural lighting and great decor that made it the perfect place to relax. Even the background music added to the vibe. soft and chill, not too loud, just perfect for a nice conversation.\nWould definitely come back again! Highly recommend if you're looking for a chill cafe with good food, great service, and a lovely environment!",

The RM25 lunch set was delicious, offering great value for the price. The service was excellent; the staff were attentive and friendly. The only downside was that the air conditioning near the window on the right side wasnt very cool, and it felt quite hot, especially in the afternoon. The lunch sets are available from 12pm to 3pm, so make sure to come within that window! Overall, a great place for a casual lunch.",

The ambiance is enhanced by the ample seating area, so youll never feel cramped, and the plenty of parking is a big plus, making it easy to visit without the usual hassle.\n\nService here is commendable, with the staff being both attentive and quick. Unfortunately, the food doesnt quite live up to the surroundings; the taste is pretty average, though the prices are fair for what you get.\n\nOne downside is the music. The choice of rave-style tracks can be a bit jarring, especially if youre looking for a more relaxed dining experience.

Their English may not be perfect, but their effort and attentiveness? Top-notch. They really go the extra mile to make you feel looked after.\n\nAnd lets not forget the kitchen crew-the chefs behind the scenes deserve major love for those delicious recipes.\n\nBig stars all around.

To minimize inconvenience, customers may consider filling multiple glasses at once.\n\n2) Table Instructions: Clear guidelines on adjusting table temperature settings would enhance the experience, as staff may be occupied during peak hours.

I seriously dont understand why it took so long to clean our table and bring our food when the food is readily there and they just have to scoop to small plates.

We observed there were only 8 tables that waited for their orders to arrive including ours. Seems the restaurant is understaff, there was only 1 person preparing the meals. Considering the price was not that cheap, the service should have been better since the final bill was not only for the food but the quality of the service as well.

Upon ordering the staff (he was wearing grey collared shirt), he came and greet us with \"uh breakfast habis eh\" with a rude tone but we still just smiled and ordered nicely to him. He didn't even look at us just ordered with a masam face and typed loudly as if he is pissed. Its only 11am???? and while we were waiting for our food, theres a blackout. Which was fine by us as it wasn't his fault BUT he was very rude and a decent customer service would atleast say \"sorry for the inconvenience\" or anything but nope. He served our food with mineral water instead of soft drinks bc requires electricity as he mentioned but he said he will give us our drinks when theres electricity. We ate and after 20 mins the electricity was back on but he didn't offer our drinks so we went up to him to ask for drinks. My friend went to the counter approached him 3 TIMES! TO HIS FACE! Yet he ignored us... Yes completely ignored us who was right in front of him. My friend said \"bang nak air boleh ke?\" 3 TIMES. IGNORED! As if there were soooo many customers there. THERE WERE ONLY ME AND MY FRIEND ! We had to go to another staff we who was sitting at the back for our drinks. Ive never felt so mad in a fast food branch before. When we left, i looked back and he was giving us a look like he was pissed with us. OMG what was his problem. FIX UR ATTITUDE! Pls check the cctv if you dont believe us !",

The service at this Burger King is disappointing and doesnt improve even when the staff is changing. The staff is always rude and dismissive. The food is always served cold. The way they make burgers is as if they were broke and they had to bring out the ingredients from their home to serve in the kitchen. Even when ordering through grab or foodpanda the food will take a minimum of one to one and half hour too reach even if the delivery location is 1 km range. Hope the management takes action or just shut down the place so not more people walk in with expectations like other outlets and get disappointed.",

                "text": "Deep Fried Chicken with Lychee in Sweet and Sour Sauce: This dish is a standout! The crispy chicken pairs perfectly with the sweet and tangy lychee sauce, creating a delightful balance of flavors. Highly recommended.\n\nHot & Spicy Clear Tomyum Soup: I opted for less spice, and it was still packed with bold, aromatic flavors. The broth was flavorful with a nice kick, though not overwhelming. A must-try for tomyum lovers.\n\nThai Oasis Drink: This drink actually consists of 3 drinks. Check out the picture. It's good.\n\nThai Omelet: Unfortunately, this was a letdown. The omelet was average at best, lacking any fillings, flavorful texture found in authentic Thai versions. It pales in comparison to what youd get in Thailand.\n\nAtmosphere: The restaurant has a pleasant and inviting atmosphere, making it a comfortable place to enjoy a meal. The cleanliness is commendable, though the cutlery could use some improvement-perhaps an upgrade in quality.",
