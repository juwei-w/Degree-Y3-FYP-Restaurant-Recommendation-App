Adding to the disappointment, I found a mosquito in my salad, and the utensils were poorly cleaned. Despite decent service, these hygiene and food quality issues are unacceptable. I hope management takes immediate action to improve these standards. Overall, while service was satisfactory, the subpar food preparation and cleanliness overshadowed the dining experience. I would not recommend this restaurant until significant improvements are made in both food quality and hygiene practices.",

The restaurant's cozy ambiance and warm atmosphere created the perfect setting for breaking fast and enjoying a delightful meal.\n\nThe menu at Al Dimashqi Kingdom Restaurant offers a wide variety of Syrian Arabic dishes, and I was particularly impressed with their shawarma, pizza, and lamb mansaf rice. The shawarma was packed with succulent and well-seasoned meat, perfectly wrapped in soft bread. The pizza had a unique Syrian twist with its blend of flavors and toppings, making it a pleasant surprise. As for the lamb mansaf rice, it was a true highlight of the meal, with tender lamb cooked to perfection and served over fragrant, flavorful rice. Each dish showcased the authentic taste of Syrian cuisine and left me wanting more.\n\nLocated in Cyberjaya, Al Dimashqi Kingdom Restaurant is a must-visit for Arabic food enthusiasts. While the prices may be slightly on the premium side, the quality and flavors of the food make it well worth it. The restaurant provides an opportunity to savor the authentic tastes of Syria without leaving Cyberjaya.\n\nDuring my visit, the staff at Al Dimashqi Kingdom Restaurant provided excellent service, catering to the needs of guests and ensuring a pleasant dining experience. Their attentiveness and knowledge of the menu added to the overall satisfaction of the visit.\n\nIf you find yourself in Cyberjaya, I highly recommend visiting Al Dimashqi Kingdom Restaurant. Whether you're breaking fast during Ramadhan or looking for a delicious Arabic meal, this restaurant offers a cozy ambiance, a variety of mouthwatering dishes including shawarma, pizza, and lamb mansaf rice, and a taste of authentic Syrian flavors.",

There are 15 of us and restaurant suggest to pre-order our food to prevent long waiting time. The moment we arrive, we were greeted warmly by Mr Tamam who is the manager and brought us to our seat. The food was almost ready and we did not have to wait long and immediately enjoyed fresh hot steaming dishes from  the kitchen.\n\nThe mixed grill was presented with fire which captured my guest and all the other food were presented very nice and appetizing. Food was delicious, mixed grill is perfectly grill and not dry, mandy chicken and lamb haneeth were nice and tender, eggplant lamb, fahsah and saltah taste good too with the fresh bread. Oh ya the mixed appetizer is very authentic and we end our dinner with most popular kunafa. We ordered 2 type (original & pistachio) and both were very very delicious. Its the best kunafa we have tasted in Malaysia. We truly enjoyed our dinner and Mr Tamam is a very great host to make sure our dining experience wonderful. This is our first and definitely not our last time and we surely enjoyed our dinner last night. Perfect place to celebrate any occasion.",

The RM25 lunch set was delicious, offering great value for the price. The service was excellent; the staff were attentive and friendly. The only downside was that the air conditioning near the window on the right side wasnt very cool, and it felt quite hot, especially in the afternoon. The lunch sets are available from 12pm to 3pm, so make sure to come within that window! Overall, a great place for a casual lunch.",

The ambiance is enhanced by the ample seating area, so youll never feel cramped, and the plenty of parking is a big plus, making it easy to visit without the usual hassle.\n\nService here is commendable, with the staff being both attentive and quick. Unfortunately, the food doesnt quite live up to the surroundings; the taste is pretty average, though the prices are fair for what you get.\n\nOne downside is the music. The choice of rave-style tracks can be a bit jarring, especially if youre looking for a more relaxed dining experience.

The mango in the mango sticky rice wasnt sweet, which was a letdown, and the pad thai was too salty, though still quite flavorful.\n\nWhat really disgust me is the way they encouraged customers to leave a 5-star review by offering free ice cream - every table had a printed paper promoting this.

Anyway...\n\nI ordered Signature Molten Egg. When the food arrived, we asked the server, he confirmed this was the dish I ordered.\n\nWhat I was eating was the Pulled Beef Egg Benedict. It was very good and flavourful. \nApologies for the poor photo quality. We took the photo after quite a few bites \n\nAvocado & Egg - I guess if you like Avocado, good. Not for me though\n\nSignature Molten Egg - Good as well. I think it was also good that the server was an idiot giving us the wrong information. This was too cheesy for me. I preferred the Pulled Beef Egg Benedict.\n\nBakers Breakfast - we think it was done very well... Very good, if you like sausages and Beef Bacon.\n\nDrinks - various. It was OK, but can be improved.\n\nFor this price point... It really have to improve a lot, if you ask me. Then again, business is so good, I guess they just don't care? \n\nWill I return? I'm not too sure. But I think my rating is quite fair and objective",

Only today I remembered there's a branch in Cyberjaya.\n\nWe ordered Shack Original Burger, Cheeseburger (both for him as his appetite isn't Nusantara size, lol) and Fish Sandwich for me because I miss that one fish burger that I no longer would consumed. The delivery arrived an hour later, well, it was for dinner.\n\nLet me say that it was heavy! And very fulfilling! The bread itself was so soft, pillowy and yummy! The lettuce, tomato slice and pickles were fresh! I love it! Now I know where to get my fish burger! My husband inhaled his food, as usual. Lolz.\n\n4 thumbs up to the Cyberjaya team! Kudos!!!",

Kebab is a bit different from the one i normally eat, got thick beef inside and can make ur tummy full. Satisfies with their food! Surely repeat and this time gonna try their mutton biryani & chai.",

Besides that, they have lots of cakes, cookies, and ice cream to enjoy after your meal which some places do not offer the same.\nMany different kinds of gravy and sauces, so you can choose what you like. The place has a nice & cozy atmosphere. Its a great place to eat with family or friends. I highly recommend it!",

The restaurant offers a diverse selection of ingredients, including a wide range of desserts and carbohydrate options. The cozy ambiance enhances the dining experience, making it an excellent choice for a relaxed meal with family and friends.\n\nMinor Areas for Improvement\n1) Glass Size: The provided glasses are relatively small, requiring frequent refills. To minimize inconvenience, customers may consider filling multiple glasses at once.\n\n2) Table Instructions: Clear guidelines on adjusting table temperature settings would enhance the experience, as staff may be occupied during peak hours. This would empower customers to manage their dining preferences without waiting for assistance.\n\nOverall, 10 pots steamboat offers a delightful dining experience with great food variety and a comfortable atmosphere. A few minor adjustments in service efficiency and convenience would further enhance customer satisfaction.",

The food was delicious, the place is beautiful, and the choice of music added to the cozy atmosphere.\n\nI was a bit sad today because there was no squid, and the beef tasted slightly sour compared to my previous visit. However, everything was still good and enjoyable. It would be great if the drinks were labeled for easier selection.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this place. Definitely worth a visit!",

We called so many times, and finally he cleaned some of the plates. Then he disappeared. We have to call numerous time again to ask finish cleaning the rest  and considering that the food was already done, it took a long time to get to our table. FYI when we arrive, theres not many people. Most of the tables are empty. I seriously dont understand why it took so long to clean our table and bring our food when the food is readily there and they just have to scoop to small plates. When the food arrive, we needed spoons. There was none on the self service table so we had to ask. Asking for spoon also take a long time wth  first and last for me",

Yes, the food was nice, but I dont think this place will be my first choice for nasi padang considering the poor service. My warm water never arrived as well. We observed there were only 8 tables that waited for their orders to arrive including ours. Seems the restaurant is understaff, there was only 1 person preparing the meals. Considering the price was not that cheap, the service should have been better since the final bill was not only for the food but the quality of the service as well. This place is not recommended especially for the elderly and young children since the service is too slow.",
