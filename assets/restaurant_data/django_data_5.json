I hope management takes immediate action to improve these standards. Overall, while service was satisfactory, the subpar food preparation and cleanliness overshadowed the dining experience.

The restaurant's cozy ambiance and warm atmosphere created the perfect setting for breaking fast and enjoying a delightful meal.\n\nThe menu at Al Dimashqi Kingdom Restaurant offers a wide variety of Syrian Arabic dishes, and I was particularly impressed with their shawarma, pizza, and lamb mansaf rice. The shawarma was packed with succulent and well-seasoned meat, perfectly wrapped in soft bread. The pizza had a unique Syrian twist with its blend of flavors and toppings, making it a pleasant surprise. As for the lamb mansaf rice, it was a true highlight of the meal, with tender lamb cooked to perfection and served over fragrant, flavorful rice. Each dish showcased the authentic taste of Syrian cuisine and left me wanting more.\n\nLocated in Cyberjaya, Al Dimashqi Kingdom Restaurant is a must-visit for Arabic food enthusiasts. While the prices may be slightly on the premium side, the quality and flavors of the food make it well worth it. The restaurant provides an opportunity to savor the authentic tastes of Syria without leaving Cyberjaya.\n\nDuring my visit, the staff at Al Dimashqi Kingdom Restaurant provided excellent service, catering to the needs of guests and ensuring a pleasant dining experience. Their attentiveness and knowledge of the menu added to the overall satisfaction of the visit.\n\nIf you find yourself in Cyberjaya, I highly recommend visiting Al Dimashqi Kingdom Restaurant. Whether you're breaking fast during Ramadhan or looking for a delicious Arabic meal, this restaurant offers a cozy ambiance, a variety of mouthwatering dishes including shawarma, pizza, and lamb mansaf rice, and a taste of authentic Syrian flavors.",

There are 15 of us and restaurant suggest to pre-order our food to prevent long waiting time. The moment we arrive, we were greeted warmly by Mr Tamam who is the manager and brought us to our seat. The food was almost ready and we did not have to wait long and immediately enjoyed fresh hot steaming dishes from  the kitchen.\n\nThe mixed grill was presented with fire which captured my guest and all the other food were presented very nice and appetizing. Food was delicious, mixed grill is perfectly grill and not dry, mandy chicken and lamb haneeth were nice and tender, eggplant lamb, fahsah and saltah taste good too with the fresh bread. Oh ya the mixed appetizer is very authentic and we end our dinner with most popular kunafa. We ordered 2 type (original & pistachio) and both were very very delicious. Its the best kunafa we have tasted in Malaysia. We truly enjoyed our dinner and Mr Tamam is a very great host to make sure our dining experience wonderful. This is our first and definitely not our last time and we surely enjoyed our dinner last night. Perfect place to celebrate any occasion.",

The vibe is okay, not too crowded but we can hear loud noise from the kitchen.\n\nHad the family meal set, very cheap and all food is fresh and delish. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. We sent our birthday cake to them and they helped to unpack it and surprise us with birthday songs once we finished the meals.\n\nOverall grear and we would come here again sometimes soon!",

I personally enjoyed the pineapple fried rice and fried kangkung - both were tasty. The mango in the mango sticky rice wasnt sweet, which was a letdown, and the pad thai was too salty, though still quite flavorful.\n\nWhat really disgust me is the way they encouraged customers to leave a 5-star review by offering free ice cream - every table had a printed paper promoting this. It felt very dishonest and manipulative.",

It was very good and flavourful. \nApologies for the poor photo quality. We took the photo after quite a few bites \n\nAvocado & Egg - I guess if you like Avocado, good. Not for me though\n\nSignature Molten Egg - Good as well. I think it was also good that the server was an idiot giving us the wrong information. This was too cheesy for me. I preferred the Pulled Beef Egg Benedict.\n\nBakers Breakfast - we think it was done very well... Very good, if you like sausages and Beef Bacon.\n\nDrinks - various. It was OK, but can be improved.\n\nFor this price point... It really have to improve a lot, if you ask me. Then again, business is so good, I guess they just don't care? \n\nWill I return? I'm not too sure. But I think my rating is quite fair and objective",

The delivery arrived an hour later, well, it was for dinner.\n\nLet me say that it was heavy! And very fulfilling! The bread itself was so soft, pillowy and yummy! The lettuce, tomato slice and pickles were fresh! I love it! Now I know where to get my fish burger! My husband inhaled his food, as usual. Lolz.\n\n4 thumbs up to the Cyberjaya team! Kudos!!!",

The restaurant offers a diverse selection of ingredients, including a wide range of desserts and carbohydrate options. The cozy ambiance enhances the dining experience, making it an excellent choice for a relaxed meal with family and friends.\n\nMinor Areas for Improvement\n1) Glass Size: The provided glasses are relatively small, requiring frequent refills. To minimize inconvenience, customers may consider filling multiple glasses at once.\n\n2) Table Instructions: Clear guidelines on adjusting table temperature settings would enhance the experience, as staff may be occupied during peak hours. This would empower customers to manage their dining preferences without waiting for assistance.\n\nOverall, 10 pots steamboat offers a delightful dining experience with great food variety and a comfortable atmosphere. A few minor adjustments in service efficiency and convenience would further enhance customer satisfaction.",

Yes, the food was nice, but I dont think this place will be my first choice for nasi padang considering the poor service. My warm water never arrived as well. We observed there were only 8 tables that waited for their orders to arrive including ours. Seems the restaurant is understaff, there was only 1 person preparing the meals. Considering the price was not that cheap, the service should have been better since the final bill was not only for the food but the quality of the service as well. This place is not recommended especially for the elderly and young children since the service is too slow.",

We called so many times, and finally he cleaned some of the plates. Then he disappeared. We have to call numerous time again to ask finish cleaning the rest  and considering that the food was already done, it took a long time to get to our table. FYI when we arrive, theres not many people. Most of the tables are empty. I seriously dont understand why it took so long to clean our table and bring our food when the food is readily there and they just have to scoop to small plates. When the food arrive, we needed spoons. There was none on the self service table so we had to ask. Asking for spoon also take a long time wth  first and last for me",

The soup has a herby notes to the taste, not just simply salty taste like some other places.\n\nThe star of the show however, is the fried beef roti. Here they make the dough thin and layered, and then shallow fried it, so that the result is very crispy outer later.

Upon ordering the staff (he was wearing grey collared shirt), he came and greet us with \"uh breakfast habis eh\" with a rude tone but we still just smiled and ordered nicely to him. He didn't even look at us just ordered with a masam face and typed loudly as if he is pissed. Its only 11am???? and while we were waiting for our food, theres a blackout. Which was fine by us as it wasn't his fault BUT he was very rude and a decent customer service would atleast say \"sorry for the inconvenience\" or anything but nope. He served our food with mineral water instead of soft drinks bc requires electricity as he mentioned but he said he will give us our drinks when theres electricity. We ate and after 20 mins the electricity was back on but he didn't offer our drinks so we went up to him to ask for drinks. My friend went to the counter approached him 3 TIMES! TO HIS FACE! Yet he ignored us... Yes completely ignored us who was right in front of him. My friend said \"bang nak air boleh ke?\" 3 TIMES. IGNORED! As if there were soooo many customers there. THERE WERE ONLY ME AND MY FRIEND ! We had to go to another staff we who was sitting at the back for our drinks. Ive never felt so mad in a fast food branch before. When we left, i looked back and he was giving us a look like he was pissed with us. OMG what was his problem. FIX UR ATTITUDE! Pls check the cctv if you dont believe us !",

The service at this Burger King is disappointing and doesnt improve even when the staff is changing. The staff is always rude and dismissive. The food is always served cold. The way they make burgers is as if they were broke and they had to bring out the ingredients from their home to serve in the kitchen. Even when ordering through grab or foodpanda the food will take a minimum of one to one and half hour too reach even if the delivery location is 1 km range. Hope the management takes action or just shut down the place so not more people walk in with expectations like other outlets and get disappointed.",
