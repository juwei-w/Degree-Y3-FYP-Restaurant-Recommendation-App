The chicken was perfectly cooked with a juicy and tender interior that melted in my mouth. The seasoning was spot on,  a harmonious blend of savoury and slightly sweet with hints of soy, garlic and ginger that elevated the natural flavour of the chicken. It was accompanied by a side of crisp fresh vegetables, soup and fresh fruit. The attention to detail and presentation made the dining experience all the more enjoyable.",

The cozy ambiance and friendly service make it a great spot for a casual meal, though be prepared for slightly higher prices.\n\nI tried the Pineapple Fried Rice, which was fragrant and well-seasoned, with juicy pineapple chunks, cashews, and a hint of curry powder. The flavors were great, but for the price, the portion could have been more generous.\n\nThe Tom Yum Soup was packed with fresh seafood and had the perfect balance of spicy and sour flavors. It was definitely a highlight of the meal, but again, it felt a bit pricey for a simple dish.\n\nFor drinks, I had a Honey Lemon, which was refreshing, and they also offer a variety of soda drinks to cool down after the heat from the Tom Yum.\n\nOverall, while the food at Soi 55 Thai Kitchen is delicious and authentic, the prices are on the higher side for basic Thai dishes. If you don‚Äôt mind spending a little extra for quality flavors, it‚Äôs still worth a visit.",

My mother loves ox tail soup in general so I brought her here. We were surprise that it comes with beef meat and not the ox meat. Its our first time having ox bone soup that doesn't come with ox meat. Also the beef meat inside is a little bit on the sad amount. They mention the soup is indeed boiled with Ox bone, I wonder if they dispose the bone with meat around the bone, that would have been a waste not to serve it as we would loved to have it.\n\nAt least she enjoyed the seafood & spring onion pancakes",

Probably the best authentic Korean place I've been to. I've only tried their kimchi-jjigae, it's what I get every single time because I'm a fan of it and it's really good! The banchan makes for a satisfying and filling meal, paired with a free bowl of rice punch. The place is very cozy, the auntie is very warm and friendly. Parking can be a nightmare here though, I recommend taking the LRT. It's about a 5 minute walk from the station to this restaurant.",

I really love their fried chicken as it‚Äôs freshly fried and doesn‚Äôt have the oily smell that you usually get from other store. My guess is that they use clean oil to fried the chicken. The sambal is of the sweet and spicy kind and overall portions are decent.\n\nThe place is clean but can be a bit stuffy during lunch hour.",

We used to buy for takeaway the LFC Golden Drumostick / Thigh Bucket (5 pieces), but no longer due to the constraints imposed that the combination should be confined to three thighs and two drumsticks, instead of free combination previously. Although the fried chicken was tasty and delicious, they were a tad dry, for those chicken already precooked. The mutton was also not so tender this time, but the long beans and cabbage were just nice. The bill came to RM95.70 for the three of us.",

Very neat and organised. Clean, and service is fast. Orders are input using a tablet carried around by the workers. Just tell them what you like and he will input it into the tablet. He will place a number plate, which is your order / customer order.\n\nWhen served, and finished, bring the number plate to the cashier's counter to make your payment. Cash and e-wallet payment accepted",

Mee goreng with scrambled egg and shredded lettuce was better than the Indomie which doesn't taste like ori, more like Maggie ayam powder + kicap pekat. Very salty.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nHaven't been back to Pelita since the last time their Mee goreng was so disappointing but decided to give it another go. Regret! Beyond annoyed üò† how difficult is it to make a plain Indomie KOSONG? Not even a sunny side up to complicate matters..shouldnt have taken\nalmost 30 minutes to be served cold, tasteless, with short broken noodle strands. The second order of roti canai came almost immediately, as if the staff had waited for my companion to decide before bringing out my order at the same time. Never again, might as well buy a whole packet from KK and cook it myself since this rubbish cost me RM5.20. Roti tasted rubbery and cold, as if premade and left there waiting for the next customer to order.\n\nTo be fair, their FRESHLY fried chicken is delicious. And if you know the ratio to mix the super spicy curries, the nasi kandar can be very nice. There is one particular staff at the nasi stand who is excellent üëå he remembers what your previous order is and can dish up the same for you...just amazing. All the best to him ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nJuly 2024\nTried again. Nasi putih RM3 + ayam bawang RM9 something + 1/2 salted egg was ok. Maggie goreng was too salty...tasted like entire packet of perencah poured over the stir fried Maggie.",

It's considerably dry but the cheese provides a good texture. The chicken was a little disappointing as it was small and thin. As you eat it does start to feel a little more salty.\n\nThe other we tried was the bacon prawn with black pepper sauce which surprised me cause it was actually sweet. Not exactly to my liking but it could appeal to those who would prefer it that way.\n\nThe staff were not attentive as after I ordered I didn't not get any physical confirmation that my order was received. Some of the staff were also arguing with each other halfway through my meal which was a turn off.",

So we decided to try either ways..\n\nWe enjoyed the unlimited japenese wagyu beef patties and aussie lamb patties that came with refillable rice, green tea and side dishes  for about Rm70 perperson.. Not overly pricey but not cheap too.. But for a celebration. Why not..\n\nWe were served by  lovely friendly servers Kevin and Chong... Chonv was very tentative and explaining and helping us enjoy the best meatballs.. The beef balls has cheese in the middle this was my fav.. The ratio of meat/fat/flavor and portion was awesome..  Hubby and I had 5 pieces each and that's our max. I mean we can go for more but why force ourselves just to making worth it..  Since we went on hubby bday were gifted a burnt cheese cake that they had and we were too full to enjoy and decided to bring it home..\n\nAll in all an awesome experience.. Enjoy the sizzling sound... Cheers",

Ordered a hamburger steak with their ‚Äòsignature‚Äô sauce and was basically served up bland meatballs. Choose the latte drink and was given this ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  This was a massive L.

                "text": "Shinmapo at SS15 Courtyard has been rebranded into Majang Meat Market and is no longer serving the same menu. Although the meat cuts, marination and side dishes are the same, the restaurant now establishes a super complicated ordering procedure by grams rather than the classic set menus that Shinmapo is known for.\n\nWhat used to be an RM120++ value set dinner for 3-4 pax with pollock soup, kimchi egg and a variety of meat cuts have now been replaced by expensive pricing of individual meats, ranging from RM3-3.50 per 10 grams.\n\nYou have to calculate on your own how many grams of meat that you require because of this ordering style, where the average is actually 250g per portion at most ala-carte K-BBQ restaurants. A 250g portion of pork belly alone costs RM75 here. Just for a tiny portion of 150g of pork belly and 200g of pork skirt, my bill came up to RM160 and was not even enough to fill my stomach for a table of 2 pax.\n\nDinner crowd is no longer packed like before after this outlet rebranding. Many families have turned away after browsing the menu, but I've confirmed that Shinmapo at The Gardens Mall remains unchanged.",

The sides were quite standard but were well done also. They do the cooking for you, which is nice, and the servers are quite friendly. You can choose to either sit inside or outside, but both are just as comfortable. Price is a bit on the high side, but for what you get, plus a nice ambience, it's not bad. Recommended!",

The Kampung Chicken combo comes with three sauces (ginger, chili, and soy) which add some spice, but I found them a bit too watery. The veggies were stir-fried with oyster sauce and topped with shallots. Good thing the meals weren‚Äôt too salty.

                "text": "This place isn‚Äôt bad, but nothing particularly spectacular either. It takes your typical, no-frills pork noodle stall‚Äîsomething you‚Äôd normally find in a hawker centre or kopitiam‚Äîand reimagines it as a polished, gentrified outlet within a modern shopping mall. The result is a cleaner, more comfortable setting with air-conditioning, trendy decor, and a slightly more ‚Äúupscale‚Äù vibe. It‚Äôs definitely more Instagram-friendly than your usual noodle stall.\n\nThe food itself is decent. The pork noodles were tasty and well-cooked, with a nice broth and a generous serving of ingredients. You can tell some thought has gone into the presentation and quality, but it doesn‚Äôt quite elevate the dish beyond what you‚Äôd expect from a good hawker version. It hits the spot, but isn‚Äôt anything that makes you sit up and go ‚Äúwow.‚Äù\n\nWhere the difference really lies is in the price. You‚Äôre definitely paying more, not necessarily for a better culinary experience, but for the ambiance, convenience, and comfort of dining in a mall environment. The staff were friendly and the service was efficient, which helps justify the cost a little.\n\nWould I come back? Yes‚Äîmainly for the convenience and clean setting, especially if I‚Äôm in the area and craving pork noodles without wanting to deal with the heat and crowd of a traditional hawker spot. It‚Äôs not a destination eatery, but it‚Äôs a solid option if you‚Äôre nearby and want a familiar dish in a more modern setting.",

Talking about the green Tomyam and white curry I have this morning, soup were acceptable but the ingredients are not.  I am very disappoint to see frozen prawns in my white curry which I will not eat.  Rest of the ingredients were subpar too.  I think the vegetables is good though with fragrance soy sauce, garlic and lard.",

It wasn't crowded during weekday lunch.\n\nThey have a 2 hour limit. One table can choose 2 broths (from 6 types), so we decided on the pork & mala version. Protein are order based while the sides like vegetables, noodles, egg, sauces, frozen items, drinks & desserts are self service. Make sure you get your dips ready before you start.\n\nWe tried all their protein except for offal. They were all good & fresh. Their meat paste & balls are all a must order. From the strong flavors to the bouncy texture. From the sliced meats my favourite has to be the beef & pork shoulder. The frozen items & vegetables are good & help flavor the broths more. Didn't get to try the noodles are they would have filled us up.\n\nOverall we enjoyed our meal. Couldn't eat worth the price but loved the experience. Will surely return & try some other broth.",

I was intrigued to see what the fuss was about, and I wasn't disappointed, though perhaps not in the way I expected.\n\nThis restaurant offers a unique dining experience by serving home-style dishes. The food wasn't bursting with intense flavors or extravagant spices; instead, it was prepared with a simple, honest approach that reminded me of a meal cooked at home. It was \"just nice,\" a comforting and familiar taste that resonated with a sense of warmth and simplicity.\n\nThe staff were attentive and friendly, ensuring that our needs were met. However, it's important to note that the ambiance is that of a typical, unpretentious coffee shop restaurant. There are no fancy decorations or elaborate settings, just a straightforward and functional space for enjoying a meal.\n\nIf you're looking for a culinary adventure or a restaurant with a trendy atmosphere, this may not be the place for you. But if you're seeking a taste of authentic, home-style cooking in a relaxed and unassuming setting, Eng Teck Hokkien Mee (Êñ∞ÈùíÂ±±Á¶èÂª∫Èù¢) is worth a visit. It's a place where you can enjoy a comforting meal that feels like it was made with care.",

The restaurant is quite small and limited seating is available but it is beautifully decorated and clean. The food is also delicious. It's a buffet with few choices and with the amounts of RM 32++, I thought it was worth it since we can order many times the foods despite the time limit. The service is also good but a few times the food will take sometimes to arrive but all the workers are nice. The atmosphere is also really cool.

They recently change to buffet only dining (RM29.90), whereby you can get unlimited refills on 6 different Korean fried chicken wing flavors, fries, chicken/beef fried rice and 1 serving of Korean army pot (with unlimited soup refills only, you can add on dishes separately). Drinks come with unlimited refills as well by adding on a small price.\n\nI prefer the signature cheesy sauce and the kimchi mustard fried chicken wings over the other flavors, they seem to be pair better with the fried chicken wings.\nChicken fried rice is not bad, very nice. Korean army pot is just so-so, may be the sauce not flavorful enough, but portion is alright.\nFries probably need to pair with sauces to taste better, otherwise I won‚Äôt recommend refilling this.\n\nKorean fried chicken is not my favorite dish, so probably won‚Äôt return. But for those who likes them, this may be an alternative and potentially cheaper option compared to famous ones like KyoChon since they offer unlimited refills.",

An unassuming restaurant serving up authentic China fare by Chinese chefs. Love the simple homecooked style dishes. There's a few mala based dishes that I've not worked up the guts to try. Loved their stir fry cabbage and seaweed soup. Big portion of rice. I'd usually order 2 bowls for 3 pax. Compliments to the wait staff. Accommodating and can remember specific requests at the next visit e.g. serving spoons for the dishes, etc.",

                "text": "Updated 17/2/25\nToday's 2 orders of chicken chop was atrocious.  So disappointing üòû unlike previously, couldn't finish as tasted so bad. Extremely tough and stringy, difficult to bite, even the fries were cold and tasted re-fried. Pieces of different chicken parts on a plate instead of one entire piece covered with a very thick boiled down intense sweet and sour sauce. Completely different from the previous times we ordered this same Hainanese Chicken chop (which used to arrive in one intact large piece, freshly fried and so hot we needed to wait until it cooled down.) One order arrived with cucumber and the other didn't. Feels as though this is previous customer's/ day's leftover chicken and just reheated for the next unfortunate ones. Rating dropped from 5 stars to 1. Please check in on this, such a pity.\n\n-------------------------\nFeb 2025\nLove this outlet...lady in charge is so bubbly and polite. Well-done staff, very good service üòä anticipating customer needs, changing an empty tissue container for a full one without prompting.  Showing the way to the toilet, all very polite. Fantastic value and open during CNY also ! Tysm!! üëç\n\nchicken chop dinner with the best promo : large crispy piece served piping hot with tangy sweet sour sauce and lots of freshly fried fries. Veggies were fresh and crisp. Kopi C was so thick and so sweet, delicious like a dessert drink but wow, a bit too filling for old folks. Not complaining though.\n\nPromo starts at 5pm -9.30 pm.\n\nHot tea was very milky less sugar.\n\n-Nasi lemak with chicken rendang. The sambal and rendang were delicious but portion too small.\n-Cantonese noodles with crunchy yee mee was really tasty and full of stuff, prawn, crabsticks (could be fresher, a bit mushy can't peel apart) and lots of veg.\n\nAll very worth the promo price. Ample seating  in clean surroundings with aircon or very pleasant outdoors, retro music and no taxes. 5/5 stars.",

Every visit here feels worthwhile because the food is consistently excellent, freshly prepared, and bursting with authentic flavours.\n\nThe stir-fried ginger onion grouper fillet is always a standout: the fish is perfectly tender and bathed in a fragrant sauce filled with ginger and scallion aroma. The balance between the mild fish and the punchy aromatics is masterful, making every bite deeply satisfying.\n\nThe beancurd and beancurd skin dish is another highlight. The silky smoothness of the tofu skin combined with the slightly chewy texture of the beancurd skin, all coated in a light savoury sauce and accompanied by fresh green vegetables, creates a wonderful contrast of textures and flavours. It‚Äôs a comforting dish that feels both hearty and nourishing.\n\nThe stir-fried pork belly with sweet green chili was a delightful surprise. The pork is tender and flavorful, paired beautifully with the mild heat and sweetness of the green and red chilies. This dish strikes a great balance between savoury, slightly spicy, and sweet, making it incredibly addictive.\n\nThe pork curry puff is a true gem on the menu. The pastry is crispy and golden, enclosing a rich, flavourful pork filling with just the right blend of spices.\n\nLastly, the stuffed bittergourd in broth is a dish that really shows the chef‚Äôs skill. The bittergourd is tender but not mushy, and the stuffing inside, usually a mix of minced meat and herbs, soaks up the light, flavourful broth beautifully. Even if you‚Äôre not usually a fan of bittergourd, this dish might just change your mind with its subtle, well-rounded flavours.\n\nOverall, every dish here is cooked with care and attention to detail. The flavours are authentic, the ingredients are fresh, and the presentation is inviting. I happily make the journey here regularly, despite the distance, because I know I can always count on an excellent, satisfying meal. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates good Chinese cuisine.",
