The chicken tender was just alright for me. But it was dry and lack of taste. Somehow over fried a little. Hazelnut latte was alright too. For a cup cost RM14, I would expect the taste to be more fragrant and slightly bigger in size too. Yes it is an expensive restaurant. Just a breakfast and it cost RM48.40.",

The teriyaki sauce was too light and bland. The soba was too dry. 4.4/10\n\nThe Crme Brle banana brown sugar was an interesting fusion, but it didn't had the caramelised top and the too soft. 4/10\n\nNice comfy restaurant with cheerful staff.",

Service was great and everything is reasonably priced.\n\nThey have 3 breakfast combos and 30% for coffee till 12pm. Good place for work. Theres free water and WiFi.\n\nThe toast looks very simple but oh so good  It taste like theres caramel in the spread. The signature chicken ramen (RM13.90) was surprisingly tasty and well portioned too. Pandan nasi lemak (RM10.90) was worth-it, good portion and yummy.\n\nSome description and pricing on the menu are a little confusing like how its an additional RM1 for ramen noodle when the picture shows ramen noodle and as for the nasi lemak, it actually comes with fried egg and chicken patty but its not mentioned instead its stated that for egg and patty, they are additional charges. Kinda confusing for us and we ended up having 2 patties and 2 fried eggs for the nasi lemak which was unnecessary. Perhaps owners can relook into the wordings of the menu and amend them.\n\nOther than that, everything was great. Place is clean, especially the toilet  , food was yummy and service was prompt and good. Recommended!",

Maybe it was a weekday.\nThe food were served one by one and it came out hot, from the oven/stove.\nThe mushroom soup was good.\nThe lamb shank was wonderful except it still had the raw lamb  taste. The chicken chop was unusual. It was layered with a full round pineapple and an egg on the top. Well marinated and wonderful combination. The salmon fish was good.",

We ordered flat lobster chowder, wild mushroom soup, pan fried garlic butter fish (served on mash potato with almond slice, roasted cherry tomatoes & garlic butter sauce), and grilled juicy chicken thigh and shrimps accompanied with Chef's BBQ sauce, and served with a side of sauted mushrooms, vegetables and a heap of mash potatoes. The space inside is a bit tight, although there are tables just outside, The food was tasty and nice, including both soups. The bill came to RM200 for the four of us.",

One of the better ones around!\n\nThe pork collar was super tender and the sauce excellent.\n\nThe service is on point too! You dont have to ask for plain water, they serve it to you! Plus they keep refilling your empty cup.\n\nVery well trained staff and the server will always be happy to give you a recommendation.\n\nWas too full to take the dessert.

Curry texture was watery though and not rich in flavor. Staff at cashier was polite and smiley. Staff serving food to our table was expressionless. We said thank you and she ignored.

This place puts it several notches higher compared to what you typically encounter from the street or shopping malls. The ambience within is relaxed and unrushed, absolutely fantastic.\n\nIf there's one thing really good here asides from their large selection of kuih muih, it's the freshly made-to-order teh and kopi beverages. The drinks are an almost perfect compliment to whatever dish you have ordered from the menu. Come around for late breakfast or brunch and make an order for fresh lempeng, a savoury pancake like snack served with sambal ikan bilis. It, is, to die for.

It's considerably dry but the cheese provides a good texture. The chicken was a little disappointing as it was small and thin. As you eat it does start to feel a little more salty.\n\nThe other we tried was the bacon prawn with black pepper sauce which surprised me cause it was actually sweet. Not exactly to my liking but it could appeal to those who would prefer it that way.\n\nThe staff were not attentive as after I ordered I didn't not get any physical confirmation that my order was received. Some of the staff were also arguing with each other halfway through my meal which was a turn off.",

Complimentary fruit-infused water is available, which adds a refreshing touch to the dining experience.\n\nFood:\nThe menu offers both local and Western options. I tried the eggs benedict and omelet set - both were tasty, fresh, and served in large portions. The salad on the side was a nice touch.\n\nService:\nThe staff were friendly and the service was smooth, with food served quickly.\n\nCost: $~$$\nThe price is reasonable, with meals starting from RM13 to RM17, considering the big portions and variety of choices available.",

Guinness are not as creamy as expected compared to Healy Mac but I would say nowadays there very few beer outlet with good Guinness.   Karaage were acceptable but the the cutting were too small making it unlike typical good Karaage that we have.

The coffee here is also exceptional. Service is good and staffs are friendly. Th the curry. Mee though is below average, it has too much MSG, it made me feel very unwell after taking hope the owner improves  by reducing MSG. I generally dont put such a remark, but this is pretty obvious.",

The Penang-style char koey teow here is on another level-intense wok hei, crispy pork lard, ultra-thin Chinese sausage, juicy prawns, and generous siham (cockles) all come together in one flavour-packed plate.\n\nThe local coffee here super good as well.\n\nThe space is clean and comfortable, with both air-conditioned and fan seating. With over 40 stalls offering everything from local favourites to international dishes, there's something for everyone.\n\nMy family keeps coming back for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even supper because the variety caters to all tastes, and it's open daily from 8am to 2am!",

The main attraction is the competitive pricing. It's probably one of the more affordable buffets you can find in the area. While you will find better spreads in other hotels, you will get your money's worth here. The restaurant itself is set up nicely. It isn't the most spacious, so it can get quite crowded if there are many people around. If you want a buffet meal with a group or team and are on a budget, I would  recommend Terraza Brasserie.",

The spread just exceeded my expectations)\n\nThe spread is not big, but the ingredients used are decent and quality. Fresh too!\n\nSeafood: scallops are huge, juicy and fresh\n\nMains: Pilaf rice was so fragrant I took 4 rounds, against my no-carb buffet policy. Carbonara sauce was creamy and rich. The assam fish had bite to it\n\nSalad counter: awesome smoked duck salad, amongst other great mix.\n\nCarving and meat station: Grilled beef had fats that almost melts in your mouth? Can't believe it coming from a hotel not many ppl talk about. Love the roast lamb and duck too. The grilled skewered prawns was so fresh!\n\nSoup: pumpkin soup was sweet and tasted nourishing. Love it.\n\nDesserts: Favourite was the chocolate fountain and the bread pudding. Simply amazing.\n\nDrinks: thoughtful infused water instead of the usual sugary drinks.\n\nWell done Terazza team. Very thoughtful spread and service. Keep it up. Will be back to support when I am over my food coma.",

We all ordered different food choices. 4 western and 2 asian, 2 of which came after 30 mins and the rest more than an hour! Whats funny was there was nobody else in the place! We came here baseD on a facebook recommendation and we were there just before 9pm. we left 10.30pm disappointed like never before in our lives! Even their drinks order was taken incorrectly such sprite, coke and water! Billing was incorrect as well. We were very patient because of my aunt who is a heart and pressure patient ... or else I would have given them a true piece of my mind!\nNEVER GO HERE UNLESS THE INTENTION IS TO HAVE ALCOHOL! But then again I can't guarantee the quality as well as we never had any.... deplorable food quality and service!",

No complaints there. Clearly, the kitchen knows what its doing once the food arrives.\n\nThe issue? The waiting time. We waited nearly 20-30 minutes per dish, and they arrived one by one like they were on their own little parade. What shouldve been a 15-minute kitchen job turned into a full-on endurance test. By the time the last plate came, I was more full of frustration than food.\n\nIs it worth the wait? For me, not really. I came hungry, not for a slow-burn food reveal. But if youve got time to kill and the patience of a saint, the food wont let you down.",

From the moment I stepped in, the atmosphere was calm and relaxing - the perfect spot to unwind, whether youre with friends or just having some alone time. The concept of the place was cozy yet modern, making it feel warm and welcoming.\n\nThe staff were incredibly friendly and attentive. They greeted us with smiles and went out of their way to be helpful. Service was top-notch and impressively fast - we didnt have to wait long for our food at all.\n\nWe ordered their signature butter chicken and the baked rice, and it was absolutely delicious. The cheese was perfectly melted, and the sauce was rich and flavorful - comfort food at its best. For dessert, we had vanilla ice cream. It was smooth, creamy, and just the right amount of sweetness to end the meal on a high note.\n\nOverall, it wasnt just about the food - it was the whole experience. Great ambiance, amazing service, and food that hits the spot. Definitely a place Id come back to and recommend to others!",

However, the location is not ideal, with limited parking available, which made getting there a bit stressful.

I for one, who hates chicken breast but their dish has changed my taste buds. Soft and juicy chicken breast, creamy mashed potatoes and cabbage on the side.\n\nExtremely well seasoned and to me, it was the perfect portion.\n\nThe best part about this stall is that, they made everything from scratch including their gravy. It is a MUST GET! MUST TRY! Meal.",

We had to get tissues to wipe the table ourselves and wipe the sticky wet menu.\n\nWe ordered indomie goreng telur mata. Wanted to change it to Telur dadar, but was told that wasn't possible, must take it as is. So we had to order the Telur dadar as a separate item, chargeed rm3.20 for it and on top of that pay for the indomie Telur mata rm6.30 even though we don't want the Telur mata. We agreed to it as we just wanted to eat what we want. But just letting others know that this is my first time a mamak restaurant is unable or maybe unwilling to change the Telur mata to telur dadar because the menu says so.\nAnother unpleasant experience is we ordered Nasi goreng pattaya.

You get to choose your egg, either fried egg, omelette or scrambled eggs. I've tried both omelette and scrambled eggs. Both also fluffy and yummy.\n\nYou get to choose the side dish too. Chicken ham, sausage, beef bacon or mushrooms.\n\nI love the hash brown too. Very cripsy. Go early on weekends if you want to have breakfast as it might get crowded  sometimes. Breakfast set is from 7:00am to 11am.\n\nPhotos are from two recent visits.",

The menu since then has been carefully curated and tweaked to the current goodness. There's a welcomed hint of local condiments and flavours in the seasoning added to the dishes ordered.\n\nWe tried some of the weekend dinner sets which were very good value for what it offered. The grilled chicken set was just right in the amount and cooked just right, no doubt a testament to the experienced kitchen crew. It was all in all a very satisfying dinner outing here which is also a fond throwback to my youth growing up around this area.",

We shared the flat white coffee and Tuna croissant. The coffee taste wasn't as strong as what the server said it would be if I chose this. I like that the tuna was given generously on the croissant. Tuna tastes good. The croissant thought it was a little hard on the outside and the inside. I was hoping the outside was lightly crisped and fluffy on the inside. The fries were good and nice.

The vibe is super chill, with good music and a nice atmosphere just perfect for a hangout thats not too loud or too packed.\n\nService was quick, we had the creamy cajun pasta, mutton varuval pizza, a chicken burger, and later added a small bucket of popcorn chicken when we decided to stay for a few more drinks! Everything was flavourful and the portion sizes were just nice, not too big and not too small.\n\nTheyve also got this solid Gin OClock promo from 3pm to 9pm where you can get gin based drinks for just RM13-RM14 which is honestly such an amazing deal!\n\nParking can be difficult, but there are valet guys around so you can just hand over your keys and go enjoy your night.\n\nHighly recommend if you're looking for relaxed spot with good food and very affordable drinks! Will definitely go again!",

The buttermilk chicken is also delicious, especially if you serve garlic bread to eat with it.\n\nThe reason for 4 star is because the main meal arent my favorite.

The chicken came in sizie smaller than my palm! On top of that it had sour taste, like spoilt meat! I returned the food to them and asked them to check, came back after 30 mins with new meal but I was already full for having to wait long.\n\nMy colleague ordered hor fun, the fishballs tasted sour too!

It has to be frozen considering the size and look + taste. This is the second time we've come here, and it's still disappointing. All the food was bad. The hokkien noodles taste nothing, and plain comes with all the FROZEN seafood. Bihun was really bad too, its overcooked and bland. The mineral RM2 for the URO brand. We can get a spritzer for the same price. Chicken chop IS SOGGY and inside taste like frozen food, its not even crisp as it looks. Pictures were a scam.\n\nAlso, the first time we came here, the noodle beef, beef tasted fishy. The popia was uncooked, and the second time was worse.",

They serve a variety of dishes, but my all-time favourite is their briyani with lamb always rich in flavour and perfectly cooked. What I really appreciate is that if im in the mood for something lighter or vegetarian, theyve got plenty of vege dishes to choose from, all packed with taste. In the evening, they also offer traditional local kuih, which is a nice touch for tea time. Overall, a solid choice for hearty meals and variety. Lulus JPJ!",

Highly recommended for dessert lovers! On the other hand, the kimchi fried rice, despite its vibrant and spicy appearance, lacks the heat one might expect. As someone who enjoys bold and spicy flavors, I found it a bit underwhelming and wouldn't recommend it if you're a spice enthusiast. Overall, it's a great spot for dessert, but the savory dishes might not hit the mark for everyone, especially those craving a real spicy kick.",

Always love their desserts but the selection has decreased a lot.\n\nWheres the beloved green tea gone?\n\nThe blueberry cheesecake bingsu rm28++ is good and their cheesecake served little warm and goey rm38++ but rather pricey.\n\nHowever the torched smore bingsu doesnt live up to its standards tho. Would rate that 4/10. Personally find it rather carcinogenic toxic with the burnt smell and weird after taste.\n\nThe staffs could be more attentive towards the cutleries given as it has some leftover stains from previous patrons.

Omg, too spicy  Should have a warning sign....is this noodle goreng with chili padi? Even considered spicy for a healthy person and totally unbearable for someone feeling unwell. RM3.50\n\nKuih is the favourite. Small but delicious. RM1.30 per piece. kuih kaswi, gula hangus, Seri muka and cucur udang.",

There was an outdoor and indoor space to your choosing. However, the food is a mix of good and bad (Roasted chicken was dry, but Ayam masak lemak cili padi is great).  The kuih is great and delicious. The price is reasonable and it is a great place for a drink and talk.",
